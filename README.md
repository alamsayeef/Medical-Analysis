# Medical-Analysis
Analysis of hospital data on different types of issues using preliminary statistics viz. Correlation, Regression, ANOVA, t-test, Chi-Sq 

This repository would act as a guide for clinical practitioner as on how to analysis their clinical data.

The solemn purpose of this repository is to provide a wide variety of dataset and the use of statistical methods for analysis used in them. This would enable non-statisticians over come the dilemma of which analysis to encorporate for what kind of data.

Each folder would represent a new data but maynot necessarily point towards a unique statistical analysis method. 


PS: All the data are hypothetical, analysis there of maynot be biologically interpretable/sound. Thank you.
